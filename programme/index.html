<h1>Programme</h1>

<p>The workshop will mainly consist of two kinds of talk: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Overview Talk</b>. The speaker is encouraged to ruminate on the future for probabilistic numerical methods and to propose some topics for collaborative research at the workshop. </li>
  <li><b>Research Talk</b>. The speaker is invited to present and discuss a probabilistic numerical method. These talks will mainly focus only on very recent research, e.g. 2018+</li>  
</ul>  
</p>
<p>
  In addition, a number of expert &ldquo;discussion leaders&rdquo; will steer sessions of <b>Collaborative Research</b> throughout the workshop.
</p>
<p>
The provisional programme is as follows:

&ldquo;Probability models for discretization uncertainty with adaptive grid designs&rdquo;<br/>
When models are defined implicitly as systems of differential equations with no closed form solution, the choice of discretization grid for their approximation represents a trade-off between accuracy of the estimated solution and computational resources.
We apply principles of statistical design to a class of sequential probability based models of discretization uncertainty for selecting the optimal discretization grid adaptively.
Our proposal is compared to other approaches in the literature.</p>

&ldquo;A Bayesian conjugate gradient method&rdquo;<br/>A fundamental task in numerical computation is the solution of large linear systems.
The conjugate gradient method is an iterative method which offers rapid convergence to the solution, particularly when an effective preconditioner is employed.
However, for more challenging systems a substantial error can be present even after many iterations have been performed.
The estimates obtained in this case are of little value unless further information can be provided about the numerical error.
We propose a novel statistical model for this numerical error set in a Bayesian framework.
Our approach is a strict generalisation of the conjugate gradient method, which is recovered as the posterior mean for a particular choice of prior.
The estimates obtained are analysed with Krylov subspace methods and a contraction result for the posterior is presented.
The method is then analysed in a simulation study as well as being applied to a challenging problem in medical imaging.</p>

&ldquo;Adaptive probabilistic numerical methods using fast transforms&rdquo;<br/>
Adaptive numerical algorithms determine the sample size required to achieve the accuracy demanded based on the function values sampled.
By assuming a Bayesian framework, probabilistic numerical methods can adaptively determine the sample size via credible intervals for the true answer.
However, these credible intervals rely on assuming a reasonable prior for the sample space of input functions.
Thus, one may assume a prior with parameters to be fit by maximum likelihood estimation.
However, evaluating the likelihood function may be costly, requiring \( O(n^3) \) operations, where \( n \) is the number of function values.
We describe situations where the the choice of data sites together with the family of covariance kernels make it possible to evaluate the likelihood function in only \( O(n \log n) \) operations.
This makes adaptive probabilistic numerical methods practical.
We describe the promise of this research direction.</p>

&ldquo;A game theoretic approach to numerical approximation and algorithm design&rdquo;<br/>
This talk will review interplays between Game Theory, Numerical Approximation and Gaussian Process Regression.
We will illustrate this interface between statistical inference and numerical analysis through problems related to numerical homogenization, operator adapted wavelets, fast solvers, and computation with dense kernel matrices.
We will emphasize open problems, unexplored areas and opportunities for collaborative research. This talk will cover joint work with F.&nbsp;Sch&auml;fer, C.&nbsp;Scovel, T.&nbsp;Sullivan and L.&nbsp;Zhang.</p>

&ldquo;Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods&rdquo;<br/>
Many probabilistic numerical methods have been introduced in recent years for tasks such as quadrature, optimisation, and the solution of differential equations.
This talk will describe, on a formal level, what a probabilistic numerical method is, and what it means for one to be Bayesian.
We will further examine the costs and benefits associated to being Bayesian, and how this differs from established notions of average-case optimality.
This talk is based upon joint work with J.&nbsp;Cockayne, M.&nbsp;Girolami, and C.&nbsp;Oates.</p>

&ldquo;An exact Bayesian probabilistic numerical method for ODEs?&rdquo;<br/>
It has been argued that Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods (BPNM) provide a coherent framework in which numerical uncertainty can be propagated. 
However, a consequence of the strict definition of BPNM is that there are currently no closed-form BPNM for the solution of ODEs. 
It is thus interesting to ask; does a closed-form BPNM for ODEs exist? 
In this talk, we demonstrate how one can indeed construct closed-form BPNM for certain ODEs that are transformation-invariant. 
The method is presented for first order ODEs of the form \( u' = f(u, x) \) and requires that certain conditions associated with the Lie algebra of the ODE are satisfied.</p>
